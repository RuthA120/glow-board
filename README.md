# Glow Board
**Glow Board** is a community driven space where users can post any questions or advice they have regarding skincare, explore products, and connect with each other through discussions.
This app focuss on delivering an interactive, modern, and fun UI experience with real-time features for skincare enjoyers!
I built Glow Board with React and used Supabase to support real-time authentication, secure logouts, and post and comment creation.
